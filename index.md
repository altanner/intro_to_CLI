## Introduction to the Command Line Interface

Welcome!

Here you will find materials to accompany our training **Introduction to the Command Line Interface**, delivered by the University of Bristol Research Software Engineering team. This document provides a reference for commands used in the session, as well as some materials beyond the scope of the course for those wishing to go further. Important warnings are noted by the ‚ùó symbol, while useful tips have a üíô next to them. This course frequently refers to the course materials, which we will get in section two, but if you are jumping ahead they are [available here](https://github.com/altanner/intro_to_CLI/raw/main/command_line_files.zip).

There are six main sections here

### Important things to remember, plus some tips

- ‚ùó The command line is case-sensitive. The letter `H` is entirely different from `h`, for example! So if you are having issues, always check your capitalisation is correct.
- ‚ùó You *can* select, cut etc with the mouse cursor, **but you cannot move the position of your typing cursor with the mouse**! You can only do that with the arrow keys. A couple of useful shortcuts are üíô `ctrl-a` is "move my cursor to the start of the line", `ctrl-e` is "move cursor to end of line", and `option-arrowkey` will move your typing cursor word by word, rather than character by character.
- üíô If it looks like the terminal is stuck, or you want to cancel a command, it is `ctrl-c`.
- üíô To exit a terminal session, type `exit`.

### Opening a command line session

All operating systems offer a terminal: 
- on MacOS you can use *Terminal* or *iTerm* (find them in Launchpad or Spotlight)
- on Windows *PowerShell*, *GitBash*, or a terminal under *Windows Subsystems for Linux* 
- Linux provides *Konsole*, *Terminal* or *xterm* as default.

Terminal windows are often white or black by default, but don't worry if yours is a different colour. When you open a terminal, you will be provided with a **prompt**. This tells you where you are, and provides a line where you will type your commands. Here is what a typical prompt looks like:

```
[at9362@dc2-d0:~] $
```

Your prompt will look different, but here is what it means

```
[ your_name @ computer_name : the_current_folder ] $
```

Here, the computer name (also known as the "hostname") is `dc2-d0`, but yours might be more friendly, like `Megans_iMac` or `ubuntu`, for example. 
The `$` sign means the terminal is waiting for a command. ‚ùó **Sometimes you will see commands on the internet which include the `$` symbol at the start of the command! You don't need to include this as part of the command, say if you cut and paste!** The name of the folder you are working in is after the `:` symbol. Here it says `~` - find out what that means in the next section.

### The anatomy of a command

The syntax of most commands is 

```
verb       (adverbs)    object(s)
or
command    (flags)      argument(s)
```

The **command** is the name of the command you are running, which is a program on your computer. **Flags** are your adverbs - how do you want the verb to be done? Then comes the **object** (or **argument**) - what you want the action to be done to. (The term **argument** is more common in programming than on command line, but it is worth understanding this word now - it is admittedly confusing to use the word "argument" in such a strange way!) Your object is is usually a file. There may be other parts of your command, perhaps an input file and an output file, or multiple flags, but in general this structure is consistent. But every first part is a `command` (a program you are running), our tools, and we manipulate these to do the work we want to do. Even simple commands like `ls` or `cd` are just tiny programs that you run - let's introduce these in the next section.
