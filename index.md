## Introduction to the Command Line Interface

Welcome!

Here you will find materials to accompany our course **Introduction to the Command Line Interface**, delivered by the University of Bristol Research Software Engineering team. This document provides a reference for commands used in the session, as well as some materials beyond the scope of the course for those wishing to go further. We also provide some text files for learning to view, search and edit on the command line. 

There are six main sections here

### Opening a command line session

All operating systems offer a terminal: 
- on MacOS you can use *Terminal* or *iTerm* (find them in Launchpad or Spotlight)
- on Windows *PowerShell*, *GitBash*, or a terminal under *Windows Subsystems for Linux* 
- Linux provides *Konsole*, *Terminal* or *xterm* as default.

Terminal windows are often white or black by default, but don't worry if yours is a different colour. When you open a terminal, you will be provided with a **prompt**. This tells you where you are, and provides a line where you will type your commands. Here is what a typical prompt looks like:

```
[at9362@dc2-d0:~] $
```

Your prompt will look different, but here is what it means

```
[ your_name @ computer_name : the_current_folder ] $
```

Here, the computer name (also known as the "hostname") is `dc2-d0`, but yours might be more friendly, like `Megans_iMac` or `ubuntu`, for example. 
The `$` sign means the terminal is waiting for a command. **Sometimes you will see commands on the internet which include the `$` symbol at the start of the command! You don't need to include this as part of the command, say if you cut and paste!** The name of the folder you are working in is after the `:` symbol. Here it says `~` - what does that mean?
