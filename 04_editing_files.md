### Editing files

We can create and modify files on the command line using text editors. These are like very minimal, stripped-back word-processors, with no formatting options, but with many powerful ways of editing that are not available in word-processors. There are lots of different command line editors, which range from user-friendly (but less powerful), to more difficult (but powerful, once the shortcuts and other tricks are learned). Some examples are `nano`, `micro`, `emacs`, and `vim`, with `vim` being the slowest to learn. `nano` is the easiest for beginners, and is available on most systems, so we will use that. Run this command:

```
nano animals.txt
```

The screen will look a little different: just like with `less`, *you are now not on the command line*, but running the program called `nano`. Try making some changes to the file. There are many shortcuts that `nano` can do, but for now I will just tell you that to 💙 save you press `ctrl-o` ("output a file"), `ctrl-w` is search ("where?"), and `ctrl-x` is used to leave `nano`. Note that there is a basic cheatsheet along the bottom of the screen for some common commands inside `nano`. Also, you can create a new file using the command

```
nano my_new_file
```

💙 ❗ Note that in Linux systems and MacOS, the file extensions (for example `.txt` or `.mp3` or `.pdf`) are entirely optional. You can even have multiple extensions, like `file.txt.new.extension`, which to Linux system is all just the name. ❗ In Windows, file extensions are important!

If you try to leave `nano` (`ctrl-x`) when there are unsaved changes, it will ask to `save modified buffer?`. 💙 "Buffer", in CLI speak, is information that exists on your screen, or in your RAM, but does not exist in memory storage. So, save or not with `y` or `n`, and let's look at examining files back on the command line.
